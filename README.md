```

### Arguments

- `-w, --want`: One or more item names you want to track. *(Default: `初音未来`)*
- `-p, --price`: Price range in cents. *(Default: `10000-20000` `20000-0`)*
  - `0-2000`: 0 to 20 RMB Yuan
  - `2000-3000`: 20 to 30 RMB Yuan
  - `3000-5000`: 30 to 50 RMB Yuan
  - `5000-10000`: 50 to 100 RMB Yuan
  - `10000-20000`: 100 to 200 RMB Yuan
  - `20000-0`: 200 RMB Yuan and more
- `-d, --discount`: Discount percentage range. *(Default: `0-30` `30-50` `50-70` `70-100`)*
  - `0-30`: 100% to 70% discount

  - `fudai_cate_id`：Fudai
- `--id`: Specify if want to continue searching. (Read nextId from `nextId.txt`)

> ⚠️ **Note:** As of **2025-02-20**, the server only accepts certain `--price` and `--discount` parameters above. Providing unsupported `--price` and `--discount` will result in empty data.

### Example

```sh
python3 main.py -w 初音未来 孤独摇滚 -p 5000-10000 10000-20000 20000-0 -d 50-70 70-100
```

or

```sh
sh main.sh -w fufu -p 10000-20000 -c 2331
```

This will generate 2 CSV files like `total_*.csv` and `want_*.csv`, while the data was automatically saved into the SQLite database (`bilidata.db`) after each successful page fetch.

It will stop after getting all items, or you can stop it manually by pressing *control+c*.

### In case of interruption

It happens sometimes when the script was stopped accidently or intentionally but you whatever want to continue searching. During this kind of situation you can simply run:

```sh
python3 main.py <previous_parameters> --id
```

or

```sh
sh main.sh <previous_parameters> --id
```

For example:

```sh
python3 main.py -w 初音未来 孤独摇滚 -p 5000-10000 10000-20000 20000-0 -d 50-70 70-100 --id
```

It will continue searching from where you stopped, perfectly avoid repeated search.


## About Data

### CSV Files

The generated CSV files will have 6 columns, **without** a header row:

| Column Name | Description | Example |
|-|-|-|
| **Timestamp** | Timestamp of data collection. | `2025-02-01 16:04:41.964444` |
| **Product Name** | Name of the product. | `S-FIRE 初音未来 秋日之约Ver. 正比手办` |
| **Product ID** | Unique product identifier. | `142389472138` |
| **Current Price** | Selling price of the product in cents. | `34344` |
| **Original Price** | Original price of the product in cents. | `50500` |
| **Discount Rate** | Discount rate of the product. | `0.6800792079207921` |

- After scraping, you can sort the CSV files by item name and discount rate by running:

   ```bash
   sh sort_total.sh
   ```

   This will generate 2 sorted files like `sort_total_*.csv` and `sort_want_*.csv`.

### Database
The database will have a similar structure:

| Column Name | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `id` | TEXT | Unique product identifier (Primary Key). |
| `name` | TEXT | Name of the product. |
| `price` | INTEGER | Selling price of the product in cents. |
| `market_price` | INTEGER | Original price of the product in cents. |
| `rate` | REAL | Discount rate of the product. |
| `time` | TEXT | Timestamp of data collection. |

It can be queried using tools like `DB Browser for SQLite` or via Python.
- In case of main script error, run

   ```sh
   python3 db.py
   ```

   to manually save data from CSV files into the database.


## How can I use the data

You may access a specfic item by its product id, just use the following link but ***replace `<REPLACE_THIS_WITH_PRODUCT_ID>` with the product id*** in your browser:
```
https://mall.bilibili.com/neul-next/index.html?page=magic-market_detail&noTitleBar=1&itemsId=<REPLACE_THIS_WITH_PRODUCT_ID>&from=market_index
```
For example the link should be like:

```
https://mall.bilibili.com/neul-next/index.html?page=magic-market_detail&noTitleBar=1&itemsId=142389472138&from=market_index
```
